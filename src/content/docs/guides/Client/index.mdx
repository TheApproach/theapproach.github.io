Approach Interface defines a standard pipeline for interfacing your system. GUI, TUI, API, etc.

Interface gives yuo the option to launch AJAX requests purely in HTML or a use a lot of cool combinations with
Autoform and send data intents to the server.

The most important functions of Interface are:

1. Interface.call.events
2. Interface.call.Service
3. Interface.call.Ajax

## Creating an Interface

Including the `approach.interface.js` in your project will give you automatically give you access to all of the
Interface functions.

To create a new Interface node, you can add a `Interface` class to your HTML element.

```html
<div class="Interface"></div>
```

This is cause the creation of an internal Interface object that will be used to manage the node, which looks
like this:

```javascript
[element].Interface = new Interface();
```

The Interface object can be extended to add custom behavior. 
However, for now, it is important to understand that all events captured by the `.controls` 
within an `.Interface` will be handled by that Interface object. This significantly reduces event processing. 
Additionally, controls will only bind listeners inside themselves to `.control` elements for specific 
events, such as the default `click` event.

The `.controls` class is a special class that is used to define if a particular element is a parent of a control.
A `.control` class is used to define if a particular element is a control. 

Elements that have the `.control` class will be used to bind event listeners to.

To augment the experience of Interface, you can also use `Autoform` to automagically gather form data and send it to the server.

Look at the example in the next section to learn how to use Interface.
