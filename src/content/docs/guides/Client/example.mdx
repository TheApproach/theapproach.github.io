title: Example using Interface
---

Given below is an example of using interface to create a signin form.

```html
<div class="Interface">
    <div class="tab InterfaceContent" id="Survey">
        <form class="p-3 Autoform" data-action="Survey">
            <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" class="form-control">
            <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Email" class="form-control">
        </form>
    </div>
    <div class="controls">
        <button
        type="button"
        class="visual control btn btn-secondary mt-3"
        data-api="/server.php"
        data-role='autoform'
        data-api-method="POST"
        data-intent='{ "REFRESH": { "Server" : "Save" } }'
        data-context='{ "_response_target": "#result"}'
        >
            Click Me!
        </button>
    </div>
    <div id="result"></div>
</div>
```

The above code creates a form with two input fields. When the button is clicked, the form data is sent to the server and the response is displayed in the `#result` div.
You can create a `Service` that rests on the server and has a `/server.php` endpoint to handle the form data. The `Service` can be created as shown below:

```php
class Server extends Service{
    public function __construct(
		bool $auto_dispatch = false,
		?format $format_in = format::json,
	) {

		self::$registrar['Server']['Save'] = function ($context) {
			return self::View($context);
		};
		parent::__construct($flow, $auto_dispatch, $format_in, $format_out, $target_in, $target_out, $input, $output, $metadata);
	}

	public function Process(?array $payload = null): void
	{
		$payload = $payload ?? $this->payload;
		foreach ($payload as $verb => $intent) {
			foreach ($intent as $scope => $instruction) {
				foreach ($instruction as $command => $context) {
					$this->payload = self::$registrar[$command][$context]($action);
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Now, when a user enters the name and email and clicks the button, the form data is sent to the server and the response is displayed in the `#result` div.
The actual `payload` sent to the server is:

```json
{
    "REFRESH": {
        "Server": "Save",
        "Survey": {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "wow@cool.com"
        }
    }
}
```

## Understanding the code

We'll be taking a closer look at the Submit Button and the Form, for more info on the Service, check the [Service](/docs/service) documentation.

We start the `div` with the class `Interface`. This is the parent container for the form and the submit button.
This ensures that Approach will be able to initialize an Interface for the div.

### Form

Take a look at the form

```html
<form class="p-3 Autoform" data-action="Survey">
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" class="form-control">
    <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Email" class="form-control">
</form>
```

In this, you can notice the `Autoform` class. This is a special class that tells Approach to handle the form submission. The `data-action` attribute is used to specify the action that will be sent to the server. In this case, the action is `Survey`.
This means that the name and email are sent to the server grouped under the `Survey` action.

### Submit Button

Now, this is the submit button that actually triggers the form submission.

```html
<button
    type="button"
    class="visual control btn btn-secondary mt-3"
    data-api="/server.php"
    data-role='autoform'
    data-api-method="POST"
    data-intent='{ "REFRESH": { "Server" : "Save" } }'
    data-context='{ "_response_target": "#result"}'
    >
    Click Me!
</button>
```

This snippet tells Interface that 

1. The role of this control is to launch a Service request call. Generally this means AJAX to a server.
2. The API endpoint is `/server.php` that is where the Service is located.
3. The method of the API call is `POST`, as specified by `data-api-method`.
4. The intent of the call is to `REFRESH` the `Client` with the response from the `Server` action `Save`.
5. The context of the call is to update the `#result` div with the response from the server. This is essentially the support payload, which is used to specify any additional information that the server might need to process the request.
