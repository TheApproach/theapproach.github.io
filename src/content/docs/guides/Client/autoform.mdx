description: Autoform.js gathers data from forms and includes it with a Service intent
---

Autoform is part of the standard pipeline for sending intents to a `Service`.
It automagically gathers and includes form data with the data that is being piped to the Service.
It can be thought of as a organizer for form data.

Autoform is a part of the `approach.autoform.js` module.
and can be used to better improve the `Interface` and `Service` interaction.

## Working

Autoform looks for forms that have the `Autoform` class, then based on the `data-action` attribute,
form data is grouped and piped to the Service.

Autoform has to always be used in a node that is recognized as an `Interface`, ie it's parent should have
an `Interface` class.

## Example

```html
<div class="tab tab2 Interface InterfaceContent" id="Survey">
    <form class="p-3 Autoform" data-action="Survey">
        <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" class="form-control">
        <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Email" class="form-control">
    </form>
</div>
```

Notice the `Autoform` class and the `data-action` attribute. This is the minimum requirement for Autoform to work.

Now, to "submit" the form, you can use a button with the `data-role="autoform` attribute.

```html
<div class="controls">
    <button
    type="button"
    class="visual control btn btn-secondary mt-3"
    data-api="/server.php"
    data-role='autoform'
    data-api-method="POST"
    data-intent='{ "REFRESH": { "Server" : "Save" } }'
    data-context='{ "_response_target": "#result"}'
    >
        Click Me!
    </button>
</div>
```

This sends the intent to the server with the following data:

```json
{
    "REFRESH": {
        "Server": "Save",
        "Survey": {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "wow@cool.com"
        }
    }
}
```

## Use Cases

Autoform can be used to build complex forms and automagically categorize form data.
It can be used to build surveys, feedback forms and much more.
