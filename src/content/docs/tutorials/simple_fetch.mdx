title: Simple Fetching
description: A simple example of fetching data from the service
---

The below is a small tutorial on how to do a simple data fetch and render the results on the page.
This tutorial assumes that you have the approach PHP library and the javascript library all set up and working.
In a future tutorial, I'll be discussing how to do that setup.

But for now, all you need to get started is a project with the approach PHP library and the javascript library installed.
This tutorial also assumes that you have read through the documentation and have a basic understanding of how Service and Render layers work.

## Layers We Use

We use two layers in this tutorial, the Service layer and the Render layer.
We will not be using the resource layer in this example in order to keep the whole process a bit approachable.

- **Service Layer**: This layer serves data.
- **Render Layer**: This layer is responsible for rendering the data on the page.

We will also be emulating the resource layer with a very simple JSON file.

## Service Layer

How about we first set up the service layer?

### Setting up

To set up service, open up your src/Service/ directory and create a new file called `Server.php`.
In here, we will be creating a simple service that returns a list of users.

```php
<?php

namespace SimpleFetch\Service;

require_once __DIR__ . '/../../support/lib/vendor/autoload.php';

use Approach\Render\HTML;
use Approach\Render\The;
use Approach\Service\Service;
use Approach\Service\target;
use Approach\Service\format;
use Approach\Service\flow;
```

These are all the stuff we will be needing for this tutorial.
Now, we define a `Server` class that extends the Service class and we override the `Process` method all the while using the 
parent constructor to set up the service.

```php
class Server extends Service
{
	public static $registrar = [];

    public function __construct(
		flow $flow = flow::in,
		bool $auto_dispatch = false,
		?format $format_in = format::json,
		?format $format_out = format::json,
		?target $target_in = target::stream,
		?target $target_out = target::stream,
		$input = [Service::STDIN],
		$output = [Service::STDOUT],
		mixed $metadata = [],
		bool $register_connection = true
	) {
		parent::__construct($flow, $auto_dispatch, $format_in, $format_out, $target_in, $target_out, $input, $output, $metadata);
	}

    public function Process(?array $payload = null): void
	{
		$payload = $payload ?? $this->payload;

		$action = $payload[0]['support'];

		foreach ($payload[0] as $verb => $intent) {
			foreach ($intent as $scope => $instruction) {
				foreach ($instruction as $command => $context) {
                    $this->payload = self::$registrar[$command][$context]($action);
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Constructor

As mentioned in the Service documentation, the constructor is used to set up the service.
The constructor takes in a lot of parameters, but for this tutorial, we will only be using the first 5 parameters.
The rest of the parameters are optional and are not used in this tutorial.

- **flow**: This parameter is used to set the flow of the service. We set it to `flow::in` to indicate that the service is an input service.
- **auto_dispatch**: This parameter is used to set whether the service should automatically dispatch or not. We set it to `false` to indicate that the service should not automatically dispatch.
- **format_in**: This parameter is used to set the format of the input. We set it to `format::json` to indicate that the input format is JSON.
- **format_out**: This parameter is used to set the format of the output. We set it to `format::json` to indicate that the output format is JSON.
- **target_in**: This parameter is used to set the target of the input. We set it to `target::stream` to indicate that the input target is a stream.
- **target_out**: This parameter is used to set the target of the output. We set it to `target::stream` to indicate that the output target is a stream.

With all of this out of the way, we can now just called the parent constructor with all of these parameters.

### Process Method

The `Process` method is the method that is called when the service is dispatched.
This method is responsible for processing the payload and returning the result.

In this method, we first check if the payload is null and if it is, we set it to the payload of the service.

We then loop through the payload and call the appropriate method based on the command and context.
We then set the payload to the result of the method call.

### The Registrar

The registrar is a static property that we use to store the methods that we will be calling.
This is not really the best way to do this, but for the sake of simplicity, we will be using this method.

We will be using the registrar to store the methods that we will be calling.

### Our First Method

So, let's set up out first intent.
It is going to be a simple Hello World, just a simple method that returns a string.

```php
public static function helloWorld($action): array{
    return [[
		'REFRESH' => ['#content > div' => '<div>Hello World</div>'],
	]];
}
```

This is for the sake of testing and to make sure that everything is working as expected.

Now that we have a simple method set up, we can now set up the registrar to store this method.
So now in the contructor, we can set up the registrar to store this method.

```php
self::$registrar['Fetch']['View'] = function ($context) {
	return self::helloWorld($context);
};
```

So now, our service is set up and ready to be called.

## Getting Service to Work

Now, in the root of the directory, create a `server.php`. This is going to be the end point that will be called by the approach javascript library.

```php
<?php
namespace SimpleFetch;

// Needed for apache2 servers
ob_flush();

require_once __DIR__ . '/support/lib/vendor/autoload.php';

use \SimpleFetch\Service\Server;
use \Approach\path;
use \Approach\Scope;
use \Approach\Service\target;
use \Approach\Service\format;

$path_to_project = __DIR__ . '/';
$path_to_approach = __DIR__ . '/support/lib/approach/';
$path_to_support = __DIR__ . '//support//';

global $scope;
$scope = new Scope(
	path: [
		path::project->value        =>  $path_to_project,
		path::installed->value      =>  $path_to_approach,
		path::support->value        =>  $path_to_support,
	],
);

$service = new Server(
	auto_dispatch: false,
    format_in: format::json,
    format_out: format::json,
    target_in: target::variable,
    target_out: target::stream,
    input: [
        $_POST['json']
    ],
    output: ['php://output'],
);

$output = $service->dispatch();
```

This is the end point that will be called by the approach javascript library.
Notice how we set the input to `$_POST['json']`. This is because the approach javascript library sends the payload as a JSON string in the `json` key of the POST request.

We can emulate this by sending a POST request to the server with the payload as a JSON string using any api client like Postman or Insomnia.

```json
{
  "support": {
    "_response_target": "#content>div",
  },
  "command": {
    "REFRESH": {
      "Fetch": "View"
    }
  }
}
```

Now, we will get the result of the service call and we can use it to render the result on the page.
The result will something like this:

```json
{
  "REFRESH": {
    "#content>div": "<div>Hello World</div>"
  }
}
```

## Render Layer

Now that we have a simple service set up, we can now set up the render layer.
The render layer per se is not going to responsible for the data fetching. That is the job of the approach interface library.
The render layer is going to be responsible for rendering the data on the page.

So, to do that we need to set up the approach interface library. 
This is a simple javascript library that is used to fetch data from the service and render it on the page.

### Setting up

Assuming that you already have the approach libraries in the `/static/js/approach/` directory, we now have to initialize it and
give it access to our DOM. 
Moreover, we must also include jquery < 3.5.1 and the approach library in the head of the document.
To do this however, we must first create a document.

To do this, create a simple `index.php` file in the root of the directory and initialize approach in the head of the document.

```php
<?php

namespace SimpleFetch;
require_once __DIR__ . '/support/lib/vendor/autoload.php';

use \Approach\Render\HTML;

$webpage = new HTML(tag: 'html');
$webpage->before = '<!DOCTYPE html>' . PHP_EOL;

$head = new HTML(tag: 'head');
$webpage[] = $head;
$head[] = new HTML(tag: 'meta', attributes: [
    'charset' => 'utf-8',
], selfContained: true);
$head[] = new HTML(tag: 'meta', attributes: [
    'http-equiv' => 'X-UA-Compatible',
    'content' => 'IE=edge',
], selfContained: true);
$head[] = new HTML(tag: 'meta', attributes: [
    'name' => 'viewport',
    'content' => 'width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=0',
], selfContained: true);
$head[] = new HTML(tag: 'script', attributes: [
    'src' => '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.2/jquery.min.js',
]);
$head[] = new HTML(tag: 'script', attributes: [
    'type' => 'text/javascript',
    'src' => '/static/js/approach/approach.interface.js',
]);
$head[] = new HTML(tag: 'script', attributes: [
    'src' => '/static/js/main.js',
]);

$body = new HTML(tag: 'body');
$webpage[] = $body;
```

We now have a simple document set up with the approach interface library initialized.
This is all written in PHP using Render.

### main.js

If you notice the main.js file, it is included in the head of the document, this is where we will be setting up the approach interface library.
Open up the `static/js/main.js` file and set up the approach interface library.

```javascript
let onReadyHandle = function(element, selector, markup) {
    $(element)
        .find('.Interface')
        .each(function(_, Markup) {
            let api = '/server.php';
            // Check if Markup has data-api attribute
            if ($(Markup).attr('data-api')) api = $(Markup).attr('data-api');

            Markup.Interface = new Interface({ Markup: Markup, api: api });
        });
    if ($(element).hasClass('Interface')) {
        let api = '/service/api.json';
        if ($(element).attr('data-api')) api = $(element).attr('data-api');
        element.Interface = new Interface({ Markup: element, api: api });
};

$(document).ready(function() {
    Interface.prototype.RefreshComplete = onReadyHandle;
    onReadyHandle(document, null, null);
});
```

This on ready handle is binded to the entire document and is called when the document is ready.
It is responsible for initializing the approach interface library and setting up the api endpoint.

Moreover, it is also responsible for handling the intents and refreshing the page when the data is fetched.

### Controls

If you notice the `main.js`, you'll notice that the jquery is searching for elements with the class `Interface`.
Similarly, logic in the approach interface library is also looking for elements with a certain class heirarchy in order
to categorize them into Interfaces in the first place.

So, we'll need to create a heirarchy like this

```html
<div class="Interface InterfaceContent">
    <div class="controls">
        <button class="control">
            Fetch
        </button>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="content">
    <div></div>
</div>
```

Hence, we can do this in the `index.php` file using the Render library.

```php
$interface = new HTML(tag: 'div', classes: ['Interface', 'InterfaceContent']);

$controls = new HTML(tag: 'div', classes: ['controls']);

$fetch = new HTML(tag: 'button', classes: ['control'], content: 'Fetch');

$controls[] = $fetch;
$interface[] = $controls;

$content = new HTML(tag: 'div', attributes: [
    'id' => 'content',
]);

$body[] = $interface;
$body[] = $content;
```

### Intents

Now that we have the controls set up, we can now set up the intents.
Now I won't be going into too much detail about the intents, but you can read more about them in the documentation.
We can now set up the stuff in the button to call the service and render the result on the page.

```php
<button class="control" 
    data-api="/server.php"
    data-api-method="POST"
    data-intent='{ "REFRESH": { "Fetch" : "View" } }'
    data-context='{ "_response_target": "#content > div" }'>
    Fetch
</button>
```

This is a simple button that when clicked, will call the service and render the result on the page.

## Conclusion

And there you have it, a simple example of fetching data from the service and rendering it on the page.
We have freatly reduced the amount of code we have to write and we have also made the code more readable and maintainable.

This is just a simple example of how to do this, but you can do a lot more with the approach library.
You can read more about the approach library in the documentation.
